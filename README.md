# Magic Shell
A terminal powered by AI21 Studio to run bash commands from an english description.


It is basic at the moment but I am planning to add alot more features.


Use this to install:
```bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgewoodall82/magic-shell/main/magicshellsetup.sh)```
